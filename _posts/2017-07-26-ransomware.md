Ransomware is a type of malware that, upon infection of computers or mobile devices, restricts user access to files and often threatens the permanent deletion of data unless a crypto-currency (e.g. Bitcoin) ransom is paid. The FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that _over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by year's end._ The threat of ransomware is expected to steadily increase in 2017. In their 2017 report, [The Next Tier: 8 Security Predictions for 2017](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2017){:target="_blank"}, Trend Micro forecasted _a 25% growth in the number of new ransomware families in 2017._ One reason ransomware remains profitable for cybercriminals is the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies.

**Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific. Organizations of all sizes can be targets.**
