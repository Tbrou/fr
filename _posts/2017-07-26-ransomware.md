#### Cyber-attacks are neither industry nor sector specific. Companies of all sizes can be targets.
Ransomware is a type of malware that, upon infection of computers or mobile devices, restricts user access to files and often threatens the permanent deletion of data unless a ransom is paid. In fact, the FBIâ€™s Internet Crime Complaint Center stated that _over $24 million was paid to attackers in 2015. In Q1 of 2016 alone, ransomware costs rose to $209 million, and is projected to reach $1 billion by years end._

The threat of ransomware is expected to steadily increase in 2017. In their 2017 report, [The Next Tier: 8 Security Predictions for 2017](http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2017), Trend Micro forecasted a 25% growth in the number of new ransomware families in 2017.

One reason ransomware remains profitable for cybercriminals is the rise of crypto-currencies. Digital currencies allow cybercriminals to operate without the fear of retribution since payments are not easily tracked by law enforcement agencies. 

To combat the rise in ransomware, multiple layers of security, network, and endpoint technologies are recommended. Organizations must balance how they detect, protect and respond to ransomware attacks.
