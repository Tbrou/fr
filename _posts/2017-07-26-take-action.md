We offer in-depth knowledge and expertise in analysis and interpretation of risk present in your organizational and technical environment. Our experience in secure environments at governmental and Fortune 500 organizations gives us the ability to help you better perceive the risks you face.

#### 1
An initial interview will result in a summery analysis, a definition of the scope and aims of a risk assessment specifically tailored to your organizations needs. The goal is to provide you with relevant information necessary for you to make an informed decision as to how to best manage the identified risks:

* Create the foundation of your risk management program
* Ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability of your information
* Help you define your security risks and assess their relative magnitude
* Provide you with relevant information necessary to better manage risk

#### 2
A review of your organization’s technical environment against the following three principles to understand the existing information technology framework, identifying where you are most vulnerable to accidental loss, cyber threats or attacks:

* Security Architecture: Policy, People, Process
* Preventative Controls: Technology, Tools and Techniques
* Detective Controls: Management, Monitoring and Review

#### 3
Upon completion of a Risk Assessment, you will be provided with the following:

* Project Plan – The aim, scope, and boundaries of our analysis are defined
* System Description – A system description of your organizational and technical environment is documented
* Asset Valuation and Statement of Sensitivity – Assets are identified and assessed according to value, confidentiality, integrity, and availability attributes
* Vulnerability Assessment – All software and hardware have inherent vulnerabilities; add to that faulty firewalls, lack of system updates, weak or inexistent password policies etc. Vulnerabilities in your information systems are identified
* Threat Assessment – Threat agents are identified. Scenarios are developed; capability, motivation, and likelihood are examined.
* Risk Assessment– The types of attacks that assets are vulnerable too are determined, and the level of effort (resources and capability) required by an agent to mount an attack is characterized. A measure of risk associated with your technical environment is determined
* Remediation Plans for treatment of the very high through medium priority risks – All identified risks are prioritized and a final overall assessment is provided to help form the basis of an overall effective risk mitigation strategy.

#### the outcome
* Identify and assign value to assets
* Identify vulnerabilities and associate them with the assets they expose
* Identify threats relevant to the vulnerabilities and assess them for likelihood and gravity
* Assess risk and prioritize recommendations for remediation
