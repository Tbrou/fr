Evaluating **risk** is key if we are to allocate resources in a cost-effective way to secure **assets**. Thus, it is important to understand **risk**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities** as they pertain to **assets**.

#### Asset
An asset is what we’re trying to protect. It can be people, property, and information. People may include employees and customers. Property assets consist of both tangible and intangible items that can be assigned a value. Tangible assets can be equipment. Intangible assets include reputation and proprietary information. Information may include databases, software code, critical company records, and many other intangible items.


#### Threat
A **threat** can be anything that can exploit a **vulnerability**, intentionally or accidentally, and obtain, damage, or destroy an **asset**. A **threat** is what we’re trying to protect against.

#### Vulnerability
A **vulnerability** can be a weakness or gap that can be exploited by **threats** to gain unauthorized access to an **asset**. A **vulnerability** is a weakness we try to resolve or mitigate with our protection efforts.

#### Risk
Risk is the potential for loss, damage or destruction of an **asset** as a result of a **threat** exploiting a **vulnerability**:

> ### Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk.

**Threats** may exist, but if there are no **vulnerabilities** then there is little **risk**. Similarly, you can have a **vulnerability**, but if you have no **threat**, then you have little **risk**.

Accurately assessing **threats** and identifying **vulnerabilities** is critical to understanding the **risk** to **assets**. Often, the number of **assets** potentially at risk outweighs the resources available to manage them. It is therefore extremely important to know where to apply available resources to mitigate **risk** in a cost-effective and efficient manner. **Risk assessment** is the risk management process that assigns relative priorities for mitigation plans and implementation.
