Evaluating **risk** is key if we are to allocate limited resources in protecting **assets**. It is important to understand the difference between **risk**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities** as they pertain to **assets**.

####Asset
An asset is what weâ€™re trying to protect. It can be people, property, and information. People may include employees and customers. Property assets consist of both tangible and intangible items that can be assigned a value. Tangible assets can be equipment. Intangible assets include reputation and proprietary information. Information may include databases, software code, critical company records, and many other intangible items.


####Threat
A **threat** can be anything that can exploit a **vulnerability**, intentionally or accidentally, and obtain, damage, or destroy an **asset**. A **threat** is what weâ€™re trying to protect against.

####Vulnerability
A **vulnerability** can be weaknesses or gaps in a security program that can be exploited by **threats** to gain unauthorized access to an **asset**. A **vulnerability** is a weakness or gap in our protection efforts.

####Risk
Risk is the potential for loss, damage or destruction of an **asset** as a result of a **threat** exploiting a **vulnerability**. **Risk** is the intersection of **assets**, **threats**, and **vulnerabilities**.

> ###Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk.

Risk is a function of threats exploiting vulnerabilities to obtain, damage or destroy assets. Threats may exist, but if there are no vulnerabilities then there is little/no risk. Similarly, you can have a vulnerability, but if you have no threat, then you have little/no risk.

Accurately assessing **threats** and identifying **vulnerabilities** is critical to understanding the **risk** to **assets**. It is a **risk assessment**.
