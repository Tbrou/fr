### _Intro_
We just created a Single Main Screen with ListItems from our dummy_data, but most of the time when you are creating apps you want to have more than one Screen. [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation) Let's us do that, just think of it as [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for React Native. Just run the following command to install React Navigation,
<center><strong><code>npm install --save react-navigation</code></strong></center>
