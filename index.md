## Protect your Assets

Organizations run on data; some of it critical to operations, much of it confidential. Information has become one of the most valuable **assets** an organization possesses. This [Harvard Business School article] [HBS] highlights Caesar’s Entertainment loyalty program, _Total Rewards_. The data in _Total Rewards_ was estimated to be worth over $1 billion and at the center of a very heated Caesar’s Palace bankruptcy feud with its creditors. Information in the loyalty program was deemed a more valuable **asset** then physical property, including the Roman-themed resort on the Las Vegas strip.

Protecting data **assets** against **risk** is a business requirement. It begins by identifying critical data that needs to be protected and assessing its value. The value organizations attribute to its data will enable it to optimally use the limited resources available to protect it. The quote by McGeorge Bundy at the top of the page illustrates this by comparing toothbrushes vs. diamonds. A comparable situation would be the value awarded to an organizations’ online balance sheet of long-term **assets** (equipment, furniture...) vs. its closely guarded technology patents.

A **risk assessment** will identify the exposure of **assets** to threats and vulnerabilities. Based on the **risk assessment** a plan will be formulated to mitigate the risks and secure valuable assets essential to an organisation.
